# base-converter
converts integers in any base from base 2 to base 36
## it works! why
it uses bigint so it can convert large numbers
## it doesn't work! why
negative (at the moment) and floating point numbers are invalid
## to do next
- negative numbers
- signed/unsigned
- allow number prefixes such as 0x or 0b
### maybe to do next?
- autodetect bases
- topbar menu
